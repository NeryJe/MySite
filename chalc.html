        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Chalc.io helps no-code platforms create in-app tutorials. The Client aims to improve the functionality of the
          training builder and possible tutorial player of the desktop app,
          by redesigning the existing the interface making it more useful and functional for users.</p>

        <h3>Solutions</h3>
        <p>As a team we created a platform where users can have their personal dashboard, as well as redesigned the
          builder by adding better features that are more functional and efficient for the end user.
          Implementing the agile framework we divided the work in pieces to facilitate the process, by analyzing the
          current product and working on the UI Iterations,
          Style Guide, Design Library, Prototype and Developer Handoff.</p>

        <p>In our first meeting, being that we didn’t have the proper foundation to start the project,
          we compiled some questions and properly organized them for the client.
          <br><br>Once we had a good understanding of the product and client objectives,
          our next step was to start working on the UI iterations and style guide.
          We then decided to break the project into several phases to make the process smooth and direct.

          For the style guide I worked on the typography, buttons, input fields, creating components, and variants.
          <br>This will help the team to have consistency during the design process.

          For the next step I worked on the builder, analyzing common video editors such as; iMovie and Filmora. <br>
          In addition to that I explored tutorial builders like; Loom and Camtasia. This helped me understand how
          other products work and what can be implemented for a high quality solution. I continued with inspecting the
          current product and finding
          key problems that needed to be improved.
          After analyzing other products and the builder, I designed a builder having in mind best practices that can be
          implemented for a better solution.

          the team since
          they agreed it was closer to what the client objectives were. Afterwards,
          I sent the 3 designs to the client.

          was closer
          to what he and his team had in mind, being that they are software engineers. They were looking for a design
          that can be effective

          Design Decision 2
        </h3>
        <p>The design was not yet to be finished, it needed another iteration since during my meeting
          with the client we discover the following issues:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Capturing steps:</strong> There will be a lot of back and forth when editing, toggling between the
            builder and the app in which the training is being made can be overwhelming for the user.</li>
          <li><strong>Colors: </strong>were nice but didn’t match with his concept of what chacl.io represents.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I suggested the following solutions to the client:
          Create a slide up and slide down feature, when capturing steps the user will have the option to go backward
          and forward without difficulty.
          Create a color stem based on chalc.io logo.
          The client agreed with me and decided to move on implementing these solutions.

        <h3>Design library</h3>
        <p>
          Since I’m the team leader, I decided to work on creating a design library that will help us have consistency
          during the design process as well help us ease with
          the delivery to the developers. I worked on creating buttons, input fields, icons, reviewing and redesigning
          the cards, addition implementing
          the <strong>8 point grid system </strong> to keep everything consistent.

        <h3>Design Decision 3</h3>
        <p>
          During the design process I came back and forth with the builder finding new ideas to be implemented as well
          as others to be removed.
          My goal was to create an efficient and effective design, not only for the client but also for the end user.
          During the design process I encountered myself with the next issues:

        <ol>
          <li>
            ‘Choose from library’ preferably to be removed considering that this can be added as the first step for the
            user to take action.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s no timeline display on the editing builder, users won't be able to have good control over the
            timeline when editing.
          </li>
          <li>
            ‘Add video’ feature is added twice, will lead the user to the same outcome.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s no option to go back home for the users.
          </li>

          <h4>
            Solutions:
          </h4>
          <li>Adding a ‘choose from the library’
            pop up as one of the first steps users need to take.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a timeline display feature
            for the user to have control over the timeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove ‘add video’ since there’s
            a double action that leads to the same outcome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a home button for users to go back to the dashboard when needed.
          </li>

          I played with different screens adding different versions of features having in mind
          best practices for scroll down, once I was done I came back to the team for the final decision we decided to

          As a team leader I observed that everyone has their own unique abilities, and I learned to focus on each team
          member's potential. It started with a bit of understanding of where the client wanted to go with this project.
          Since I kept a clear communication
          with the client and the team, we delivered a better version of the original product with better features
          implemented keeping in mind the users in each step of the process.
          I’m fully satisfied with the decision I made during the design process. In the end, my team members and the
          client were thankful for the effort given to the project as a team lead.

        <h3>Looking forward</h3>
        <p>
          I really enjoyed working on this project, I see so much potential in this desktop app. If I get to have the
          opportunity to implement more features I would love to do so.
          Some features that I would implement would be adding a 'members space' where users can share and collaborate
          when building the tutorials.
          I would also like to improve the experience for the members to be able to share notes so they can have a clear
          communication during the process.

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Chalc.io helps no-code platforms create in-app tutorials. The Client aims to improve the functionality of the
          training builder and possible tutorial player of the desktop app,
          by redesigning the existing the interface making it more useful and functional for users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="textarea">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>We created a fashion app that helped users to find their unique style by implementing AI and ML. We
          implemented a user centered approach through the design process.
          Based on the user stories and user flows, we designed the platform focusing on the next key features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera, Search item, Discover style </strong>based on app suggestion.</li>
          <li>Implemented AI for<strong>‘live try on’</strong>clothing items.</li>
          <li><strong>Style suggestions</strong> based on likes, and <strong>Brands recommend</strong> .</li>

          I took a more minimalist approach by adding more neat icons for the camera,

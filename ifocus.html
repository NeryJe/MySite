          <h3>Project Summary</h3>
          <p>iFocus is created to help students achieve their goals successfully. I spent time finding a solution to
            make
            a student's journey less stressful.
            iFocus is a tool to help students to stay focused and have an organized method to keep track of their time
            spent,
            as well as having a community where they can support each other by sharing their journey, ideas, etc..</p>

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>While students try their best to have a successful career, it can be difficult trying to find solutions
            that
            can help them to achieve their goals.
            Students can encounter a vast number of challenges during their study period. Staying focused and organized
            is
            one of the primary issues when accomplishing a task.
            But yes, there are many tools that can help with academic performance. Not having the right tools can be
            detrimental for a student’s career.
            It can be very difficult getting assignments done while having a social life. Having too many distractions
            can
            affect a student’s academics.
            While not only students face these issues, anyone can face this issue trying to complete a personal task or
            a
            study assignment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textarea">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Users have a vast amount of information about the best practices to stay focused.
            Since this can feel overwhelming for users, in iFocus my goal is to help students achieve their goals in a
            clear and efficient way.
            Simply by adding their task and keeping track of the time spent their goals can be achieved.
            Selecting their own time to focus and time to rest this will help them keep control over their time spent.
            Also, providing community support where all the students can interact and share their journey.</p>

          <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
          <p>Conducting this research I concluded that students have a long range of challenges while studying.
            These problems may vary in the student's personal life and external factors. 
            By not recognizing this challenge can be damaging for the student. Some students may not be aware of these
            issues so they tend to  keep making the same mistakes during their study period.  <br> <br>
            The primary points of my research will be common issues such as; having a lack of time management,
            and too many distractions.

          <p>To get insight as to how users can stay focused and productive during their study period,
            I used screener surveys to recruit participants. After interviewing them and collecting more data
            I was able to synthesize my findings into affinity groups, empathy maps, and personas.<br> <br>
            The main takeaway from these findings are; evaluations of students behaviors during their study hours.
            Understanding their needs, motivations, and their mental health.

                After school, when she gets home she checks if there's any assignments that need to be completed. To

                track of time she
                tends to use the pomodoro technique to track time. After studying, she likes to take breaks and go to

            solution to these problems. I enjoy creating solutions to these issues, this opens a new way that I see
            things now, I would love to implemented more features, such as, 'add a friend' with this feature the
            students will be able to study together in the same time lapse. I'm satisfied with the results of the final
            design, I will keep learning and helping the users to have enjoyable and memorable experiences.
